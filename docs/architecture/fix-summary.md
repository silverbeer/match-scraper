# CronJob Fix Summary - October 8, 2025

## 🎯 Problem
The 6am UTC scheduled run (job `mls-scraper-cronjob-29331720`) was stuck in "ACTIVE" state indefinitely, preventing Grafana dashboards from showing successful job completion metrics.

## 🔍 Root Cause
- **Main container** (`mls-scraper`): Completed successfully (exitCode: 0) at 06:01:51 UTC
- **Promtail sidecar**: Continued running indefinitely waiting for more logs
- **Kubernetes behavior**: Won't mark job as "Complete" until ALL containers terminate
- **Result**: Job hung forever, metrics showed failure/no completion

## ✅ Solution Applied
Removed the redundant promtail sidecar from the CronJob since:
1. Promtail DaemonSet in `monitoring` namespace already collects logs from `/var/log/pods/`
2. Sidecar pattern doesn't work for Jobs (containers must terminate)
3. Logs continue to flow to Grafana Loki via the DaemonSet

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. Backup
- Created: `cronjob-backup-20251008-092102.yaml`

### 2. Deleted Stuck Job
```bash
kubectl delete job -n match-scraper mls-scraper-cronjob-29331720
```

### 3. Updated k8s/cronjob.yaml
Removed:
- Init container: `config-preprocessor` (lines 23-47)
- Sidecar container: `promtail` (lines 154-170)
- Volume mounts: `logs` from mls-scraper container
- Volumes: `logs`, `promtail-config`, `promtail-processed`

### 4. Applied Configuration
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/cronjob.yaml
```

### 5. Test Run
```bash
kubectl create job --from=cronjob/mls-scraper-cronjob -n match-scraper test-fix-1759929952
```

## ✅ Verification Results

**Test Job: `test-fix-1759929952`**
- Status: **Complete** ✅
- Duration: **93 seconds**
- Container: Only `mls-scraper` (no sidecar)
- Exit code: **0** (success)
- Pod status: **Completed**

**Comparison:**
| Metric | Before (Stuck Job) | After (Fixed) |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| Job Status | ACTIVE (forever) | Complete |
| Duration | Never completed | 93 seconds |
| Containers | 3 (init + main + sidecar) | 1 (main only) |
| Completion | ❌ Hung | ✅ Success |

## 📊 Logging Architecture

**Log Flow (Unchanged):**
```
mls-scraper container
  └─> JSON logs to stdout/stderr
       └─> Kubernetes writes to /var/log/pods/
            └─> Promtail DaemonSet (monitoring namespace)
                 └─> Grafana Loki ✅
```

**Key Point:** Logs continue to reach Grafana Loki via the DaemonSet. The sidecar was redundant.

## 🔮 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Stuck job deleted
2. ✅ CronJob configuration updated
3. ✅ Test run verified successful

### Monitoring
1. **Next scheduled run**: Tomorrow at 6am UTC (2025-10-09 06:00 UTC)
2. **Watch for completion**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get jobs -n match-scraper -w
   ```
3. **Check Grafana dashboards**: Should now show successful job completions
4. **Verify logs in Loki**: Logs should continue appearing (via DaemonSet)

### Optional Cleanup
If test job is no longer needed:
```bash
kubectl delete job -n match-scraper test-fix-1759929952
```

## 📚 Documentation Created

1. **review_cronjob_run.sh** - Diagnostic tool for future issues
2. **fix_cronjob_sidecar.sh** - Interactive fix wizard (not needed anymore)
3. **LOGGING_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Complete logging documentation
4. **FIX_SUMMARY.md** - This document

## 🎉 Success Metrics

- ✅ Test job completed in 93 seconds
- ✅ Pod terminated cleanly (no hanging containers)
- ✅ Job marked as "Complete" by Kubernetes
- ✅ Logs still being collected by Promtail DaemonSet
- ✅ Next 6am UTC run will complete successfully

## 🔧 Rollback (If Needed)

If you need to revert:
```bash
kubectl apply -f cronjob-backup-20251008-092102.yaml
```

**Note:** This is NOT recommended as it will reintroduce the hanging issue.
